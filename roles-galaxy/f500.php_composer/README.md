php_composer
============

Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), the dependency manager for PHP.

Requirements
------------

This role is tailored towards Debian Wheezy / Jessie.

The packages `python-apt` (or `python3-apt`) must be installed.

In addition, it is assumed that the PHP CLI is already installed.

Role Variables
--------------

Specify the path where Composer will be installed:

    php_composer_install_path: /usr/local/bin/composer.phar

Composer relies on the INI directive `allow_url_fopen` turned on, and uses the `proc_open()` function.
This goes against configuration best practices, so chances are Composer won't work in all circumstances.

Another common issue is a memory limit, which is hit when computing a dependency graph.

In order to have Composer function in all (or at least most) cases, a wrapper-script is installed.
The following variables control how this wrapper functions:

    php_composer_wrapper_enabled: yes
    php_composer_wrapper_path: /usr/local/bin/composer
    php_composer_wrapper_ini_directives:
      allow_url_fopen: yes
      disable_functions: ""
      memory_limit: -1

Dependencies
------------

None.
